Drug Stock Management

Necessary purchases are calculated for any period of time depending on the stock, doses and pack sizes.

Check medication ingestion
The difference of inventories at the beginning and at the end of a period corresponds to the actual 
consumption of a drug. A target consumption according to recipe is calculated. 
The actual consumption is compared with the target consumption.

The operation of the app causes only a small effort: periodically once, eg monthly, quarterly.

Lists:
o Check list
o Shopping list
o Cost list: daily and yearly costs (choice of health insurance)

The lists can be shared with other apps: e-mail, save as a note, print.

The app uses Google timeline charts. This requires an Internet connection. 
Data exchanged over the network. But nothing is stored in the cloud.
